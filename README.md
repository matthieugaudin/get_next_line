## Project Overview

Get_Next_Line is a C function that reads a file descriptor line by line, returning one line at a time.
It is part of the 42 curriculum and focuses on understanding how files are opened, read and closed.
The bonus is the ability to handle multiple file descriptors at the same time, meaning your function can read from several files without mixing their lines.
